## Visions of positive futures in social media
This repository contains the code used for preparing the manuscript "Visions of a sustainable world for nature and people on social media".

### Contents
1. Data collection script 'Collecting tweets.R' is written in R and contains keywords, used to download the tweets.
2. File 'mocked_dataset_generated_by_chatgpt.csv' contains synthetic Twitter dataset, mocking original data for use with zero-shot and BERTopic models.
3. Jupyter notebooks, using this mocked dataset, are 'Zero_shot_filter_and_BERTopic.ipynb' for initial selecting only the tweets relevant for the positive vision of future and assigning each tweet with the most probable topic, 'Detecting_geographic_names.ipynb' for detecting countries and other geographic names in the tweets' content, and 'Final_zero_shot.ipynb' for predicting Nature Futures Framework concepts, as well as greenwashing and transformativeness potentials.
4. Final Jupyter notebook is 'Code for figures.ipynb', which was used to produce each figure for the manuscript based on two datasets: anonymised 'df_geo_recoded_anon.csv' for analysis of the general Twitter users' distribution among the countries, and also anonymised 'df_geo_recoded_with_norm_zeroshot_with_meta2_anon.csv'. We anonymised 'author_id' in these datasets with sequential 'user_1', 'user_2' etc. nicknames, as well as dropped columns containing personal data: 'lang', 'id', 'text', 'in_reply_to_user_id','cleaned_text', 'text_clean', 'Evidence', 'Representation','Representative_Docs', so only our predicted topics and probabilities remained intact.
